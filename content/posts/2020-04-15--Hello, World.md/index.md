# Welcome to FullStack.dev

## What to expect

Here I will be sharing what it takes to be a full stack developer. There are many in the community who say along the lines of 'there is no such thing as a full stack developer. Well - they are wrong, and you should pay no attention to such dismissive statements. This doesn't mean being a full stack developer is without its pitfalls and potential constraints. My aim with this blog is to show how you can play to your strengths, learn from your weaknesses and be an effective full stack developer.

## What I do

I currently work full time for the IT Partnering and Innovation team at Lancaster University, meaning my workload is incredibly dynamic and varied.

Alongside this I am currently working on a start-up, [Lexio](lexio.dev), which aims to democratise app development and make it more accessible to developers everywhere.

My experience is therefore quite broad, I am a full-stack developer, certified scrum master, and start-up co-founder. This blog will focus on the more general experiences, looking at both personal and professional development along the way.

I will at times reference my other blog, [AnthonyHumphreys.dev](https://anthonyhumphreys.dev) which focuses on the human side of development, from soft skills to Agile and developer experiences.

If there is any particular content you'd like to see, reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aphumphreys) or drop me an [email](mailto:anthony@lexio.app?subject=FullStack.dev%20Content%20Suggestion).

Thanks for visiting!
